## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

#### Option A: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up/login to your account
3. Drag your project folder directly to Netlify dashboard
4. Your site will be deployed instantly!

#### Option B: Git Integration
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Auto-deploy on every commit

### 2. Smart Contract Deployment (Remix IDE)

1. **Open Remix IDE**: Go to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)

2. **Create Contract File**: 
   - Create new file: `contracts/ShardeumTipJar.sol`
   - Copy the contract code from below

3. **Configure Network**:
   - Install MetaMask and add Shardeum network:
     - Network Name: `Shardeum Sphinx 1.X`
     - RPC URL: `https://sphinx.shardeum.org/`
     - Chain ID: `8080`
     - Currency: `SHM`
     - Explorer: `https://explorer-sphinx.shardeum.org/`

4. **Deploy Contract**:
   - Compile the contract
   - Switch to Deploy tab
   - Select "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
   - Deploy the contract
   - Copy the deployed contract address

5. **Update Frontend**:
   - Edit `app.js`
   - Replace `TIP_JAR_CONTRACT` with your deployed address
   - Redeploy to Netlify

## 📄 Smart Contract Code

Create `contracts/ShardeumTipJar.sol` in Remix:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract ShardeumTipJar {
    struct Tip {
        address sender;
        uint256 amount;
        string message;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }
    
    address public owner;
    Tip[] public tips;
    uint256 public totalTips;
    uint256 public totalAmount;
    
    event TipSent(
        address indexed sender, 
        uint256 amount, 
        string message, 
        uint256 timestamp
    );
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function sendTip(string memory message) public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Tip must be greater than 0");
        
        tips.push(Tip({
            sender: msg.sender,
            amount: msg.value,
            message: message,
            timestamp: block.timestamp
        }));
        
        totalTips++;
        totalAmount += msg.value;
        
        emit TipSent(msg.sender, msg.value, message, block.timestamp);
    }
    
    function getTip(uint256 index) public view returns (
        address sender,
        uint256 amount,
        string memory message,
        uint256 timestamp
    ) {
        require(index < tips.length, "Tip does not exist");
        Tip memory tip = tips[index];
        return (tip.sender, tip.amount, tip.message, tip.timestamp);
    }
    
    function getTipCount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return tips.length;
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        require(address(this).balance > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
        
        payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
